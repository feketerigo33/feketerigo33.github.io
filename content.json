The high cost of disengagement The beach ball scenario: only few students get opportunities to demonstrate active cognitive engagement; because too many students sit, giving no indication of what they are thinking or what they have learned TPT: techniques that allow for all students to demonstrate active participation and cognitive engagement in the topic being studied Ⅱ. A model for total participation and higher-order thinking high- or low- order of thinking: Bloom’s Taxonomy TPT cognitive engagement model Quadrant 4: fun but forgettable (low-order thinking) The ripple: start from individual→pairs or small groups→volunteers or selected students Students should first work alone and then work in groups brainstorming, otherwise the brainstorming will inhibit the ideas of individual group members. Calling on someone should be the last thing. Section 2: Classroom-Ready TPTsⅢ. TPT Tools and Supplies TPT toolkit: hold-up cards (T/F; multiple choices; emotion; number); appointment agenda; processing card; laminated paper; envelope with paper or cards; bounce cards; index cards; guided note-taking templated; tape Use resource boxes to minimize the time spent searching for supplies Ⅳ. On-the-Spot TPTs-quickly gauge the depth of student understanding of concepts being taught-insert several in a lesson the minute you notice cognitive disengagement or disconnect-require little or no advance preparation Think-Pair-Share: reflect on a question or prompt; formulate a response; discuss their responses with partners use prompts that require students to analyze the different points of view or the components; ask students to evaluate something based on concepts learned Quick writes: 3-5 min for students to collect their thoughts and jot down a response; followed up with pair-share, networking session or chalkboard splash ask students to make connections between concepts and effects; use wide-open questions; ask students to understand the broader implications of what they are learning use a word bank to ensure the target vocabulary or concepts Quick-Draws: 3-5min for students to reflect on a concept and create a visual image; share and explain with a partner think of big ideas or concepts to synthesize Quick-Draw Gallery Walk: students label their quick-draws with a brief explanation; hang their work around the room; grad their notebooks and walk around, take notes on the content-related themes ask students to find some new themes from the works; ask them to create a sentence that encapsulates the imagery in their peer’s picture Chalkboard Splash: students record their responses on the room’s boards; analyze peer responses for similarities, differences and surprises; group share what they have found Thumbs-Up When Ready and Processing Cards: students reflect on a prompt; when they have a thought or are finished, they should put their thumb up; pair share or use processing cards (can be folded into “tents”): Still thinking/Ready to share thumbs can be used for quick activities; cards can be used for longer activities Similes: teacher creates similes using topics; students explain the true similes; after a few times, ask students to create their own similes use some cloze sentences: [topic] was like _ in that _. Rankings: ask students to rank the items/concepts/steps/events/descriptive paragraphs; ask students to provide a justification for the rankings; share with peers and change the order based on new information key thinking process: analyze Numbered Heads Together: each group member will be assigned a number; call out a random number of each group to share their discussion Make sure the assigning of roles is equitable Thumb Up/ Down Vote: ask a yes/no or agree/disagree question; ask students to complete a quick-write or do a pair share; then ask everyone to vote and ask students to share their rationales for their responses Ⅴ. TPT Hold-Ups-interaction-based activities using response cards-students reflect on a prompt and hold up a card, paper, or white board in response-process of all hold-ups: ask students to think about a set of prepared questions/have them share and discuss/say “Hold it up” and students hold up their cards/select students to share their group’s rationale for their choice-use wrong answers for teaching; provide opportunity to explain their thinking; use questions that require them to analyze and make connections between the components inherent in the concepts you’re teaching Selected-Response Hold-Ups: use a selection of relevant choices that are prepared beforehand Number Card Hold-Ups: for mathematics lesson True/Not True Hold-Ups: Four parts: true, not true, true with modifications, unable to determine(based on information learned) can also have students write statements on sticky notes to be attached to a chart-paper Multiple-Choice Hold-Ups: ABCD cards which represent options that will change with each topic Whiteboard Hold-Ups: individual student whiteboards for the teacher circulate to see how individual students are problem solving Ⅵ. TPTs Involving Movement-students will be manipulating objects or be out of their seats, interacting and processing their learning together Line-Ups and Inside-Outside Circles: prepare questions and ask students to see them first; ask them to stand in two lines or in two concentric circles; students have to turn and face the students and take turns talking it over; ring a bell and ask students to move steps and everyone talk to the new partner use questions that require students to discuss, make connections and justifications Three 3’s in a Row: prepare 9 questions; students walk around the room asking peers to answer; ask students to share their responses include big questions that require students to analyze, synthesize and evaluate components of the concepts can be used as an overall wrap-up of a unit Networking Sessions: prepare 1-4 questions; ask students to find someone they haven’t talk to that day and discuss their responses; ask students to talk to another person use questions that require higher-order thinking Categorizing and Sorting: give students some items and ask them to put into categories Appointment Agenda: students create appointments with peers by writing each other’s name in a specific time slot; teacher selects a time and students meet up with the person on the schedule Bounce Cards: select a student to practice modeling and also a wrong way; discuss the following approaches: bounce/sum it up/ask a question; ask students to pracitce conversational skills that can also be used for everyday lives create a large chart-paper model so students can refer to the chart Feature Walk: ask students to work in groups and reflect on the text feature; ask students to move in the same direction to the next feature posted Simulations: make content relevant to the lives of students Ⅶ. TPTs to Guide Note Taking and Concept Analysis-support students to summarize content delivered through direct instruction Confer, Compare, and Clarify: ask students to pair up; confer means getting together and sharing a one-sentence summary of what they believe was the most important part of the presentation; compare means comparing peer’s notes; clarify means students recording any questions they have regarding what was presented;ask pairs to join other pairs; ask students to record the questions that couldn’t be answered on the board in a Chalkboard Splash use prompts to help students analyze the effectiveness of their own notetaking Graphic Organizers and Prepared Packets: teacher prepared handouts with cues and spaces for students to fill in key information during a lecture [eg: causes, results, effects today] prompt students to connect the learning to the world around them Anticipatory Guides: create true/false statements; ask students to read them and predict the responses and write down the answers in “Before” column; ask students to pair-share; debrief the activity by voting use statements that are not very clearly true or false can be used as introduction or pre-unit activity Picture Notes: insert several “picture-pause” in the lessons; ask students to draw pictures illustrating the concepts; pair share; at the end of the lesson, ask the students to consolidate what they have learned into a final drawing that captures the big picture and a summary statement can be followed by a Chalkboard Splash encourage students to use symbolism Lecture T-Chart: two columns: Notes and Sum it up during the presentation, students write in the left column; at several pause points, ask students to read over notes and summarize; allow them to pair-sharing can ask students to predict what’s coming next in a presentation; or ask them to reflect on what they think the implications of the content might be for their world today Reflection Logs: divide lessons into logical sections and create a template that includes pause points; stop the lesson at each point, ask students to take 2-3 min to summarize and explain; ask them to stand up and pair share ask students to be selective and specific Pause, Star, Rank: allows students to review notes while the concepts are still fresh in their minds at the end of a lecture, ask students to review their notes and place stars next to the most important concepts; select 3 most important ones and create summary sentences; rank the summary sentences; pair share can be used as wrap-ups Key-Word Dance: at the end of a lecture, ask students to review their notes and underline important words from the notes; ask students to use the words create a Key word dance; encourage them to use repetitive phrases to add to the poetic feel of the writing; share require modelling Debate Team Carousel: allows students to see different aspects of an issue ask students to read the prompt and complete the boxes; ask students to pass papers to the right, add a supporting rationale; discuss together Cut-and-Pastes: ask students to cut the sentences from text and paste them into different categories Ⅷ. TPT Wrap-Ups IQ Cards: two parts: an insight and a question; ask students to take their card and pass the cards to another classmate; ask the whole group to address commonalities in the insights and questions ask students to think in terms of big-picture items One-Word Summary: ask students to select one word that best describes the lesson content and record the words on quick-write sheets; pair them up and share “What’s It Really About” Carousel: three columns: What’s it really about?/ Ok, but what’s it really, REALLY about?/ Add anything else that might have been missed. Add to, or elaborate on, your peers’ entries. students get deeper and get to the essence of the problem through this excellent for helping students to analyze content that is rich with implications, inferences, and deeper purposes A Better Table Summary: students summarize the lesson using one sentence; students get into groups and consolidate sentences into larger summary; give them a large piece of paper and fold the paper into 3 parts; students record their summary in the first section; pass the paper to other groups and read peers’ table analyzing what is missing; groups write the improved sentence underneath the original sentence in the second section; …; students read their table and underline portions of the summaries that they think improved their original summaries give students a specific number of improvements (eg. add 2 new concepts to improve) The Biggest Aha Quick-Write: biggest aha means the most important insight; students write on their quick-write sheet; meet with students they haven’t spoken to and share ask them to use specific details to explain why the aha is meaningful to them The Biggest Aha Bar Graph: ask one student to share; on a sheet of paper, ask students to tape their similar ahas and different ahas (below the original one and in a new category) The Three-Sentence Wrap-Up: students use three sentences summarizing a unit; share them in groups and refine their summaries A-Z Sentence Summary: assign students a letter of the alphabet; students create a one-sentence summary with the letter; do a Chalkboard Splash and attach the sentences ask students to create a second sentence with relevance component like clarification 1,2,3 O’Clock: each time represent a question and students meet with each other according to Appointment Agenda ask students to collect insights that they will borrow from classmates List, Group, Label: students do individual brainstorm and record all the concepts associated with the main topic; students work in groups and write ther ideas on a large chart paper; students use different color markers to review the contributions and mark categories The Six-Slide Review: students desgin the layout of a presentation with 6 slides; share in groups and each students select what are the most important points; do a chalkboard splash and share one most important slides learned from others and explain reasons Section 3: TPTs in More DepthⅨ. TPTs as Formative Assessment Tools Formative assessments help teachers evaluate students’ knowledge and understanding and then adjust their teaching to produce improved student learning; The instruction results in increased positive outcomes relative to the expected outcome if no changes had been made; Formative assessment is a response to what students need, and effective use results in student progress. Chalkboard splashes and Hold-ups can be used for formative assessment (debrief and assess students’ understandings of a text); allow teacher to affect and further develop what students know by specifically targeting what they need Ⅸ. Building a TPT-Conducive Classroom Teacher have to get comfortable with losing some of the control; have to create classroom communities that honor student differences and promote peer acceptance (trust between each other); requires consistency and followthrough Appreciating student differences: use multiple ways of giving students opportunities to demonstrate the depths of their cognitive abilities Forstering student collaboration: think of the ways of grouping based on your own teaching style Building confidence: demonstrate acceptance and strategically plan students’ successful inclusion Building trust: students are being asked to take risks, and they need to know that what they say will be valued Walking around and following through: keep students accountable for completing their tasks; make comments regarding their interactions and input Moving away from right/wrong: mutilple possibilities may exist for higher-order thinking questions","link":"/2020/05/26/%E3%80%8ATotal%20Participation%20Technique%E3%80%8B%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0/"}],"tags":[{"name":"读书笔记","slug":"读书笔记","link":"/tags/%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0/"},{"name":"教育学","slug":"教育学","link":"/tags/%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%AD%A6/"},{"name":"英语教育","slug":"英语教育","link":"/tags/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2/"}],"categories":[{"name":"教育学","slug":"教育学","link":"/categories/%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%AD%A6/"}]}
